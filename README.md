> [!IMPORTANT]
> As for now, the aces and the ~~wees~~ 2s of each suit have been made, i'll start making the numbered cards when i have some spare time.
> You can test it if you want but it's far from being done.

## How to ~~install~~ test Balajeweled
0. Install [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steamodded 1.0.0-ALPHA](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) **_(Your AV may freak out after downloading Lovely, don't fret, Lovely is completely safe to download, you'll have to whitelist Lovely in your AV)_**
1. Download the zip file of this repo by clicking on "Code" then "Download ZIP" (A release version will be made after i'm finished with the number cards).
2. Extract the contents of the zip in a folder called "Balajeweled" in your Balatro mods folder.
3. Upon entering the game, go to "Options" and "Customize deck", set all suits to "Balajeweled"
4. If everything's fine, you are all set :D
